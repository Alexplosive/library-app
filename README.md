### Problems

I spent a lot of time learning new concepts that I had not yet learned that I knew we would be using like jotai, vite development, and tailwind. This time that I used up made me not finish all the tasks and do some things wrong. I should use a router next time instead of a variable. This application is made more for clients as I had not understood until i really read the instructions about the users since I was leaving that for last. So the reservation of books is done by clients technically but in reality it should be by the employees. There is also a lot of performance issues which could be fixed if I had more time. I still learned a lot from this assignment.
